                This project deals with the design and development of the front-end UI of an imaginary restaurant called
                Ristorante Con Fusion using the Angular 4 framework. This was done by creating a Single Page Angular application.
                I carried out this one to learn and explore the features of the Angular framework and also TypeScript syntax and
                understand how it differs from ordinary JavaScript. As can be seen in the screenshot images, there are four sections
                in the website: Home, About, Menu and Contact and each section was represented by the component of the same name respectively.<br>
                I also tried to simulate the exchange of information between the client and a remote server by making use of the JSON 
                server, which works based on REST and comes with the Angular-CLI. Both servers were run on the same local machine, the former for storing
                the data and the latter for hosting the UI, and communication between the two was through the Restangular module. The user can submit his feedback
                using the form in the Contact section and this will be stored on the JSON server, which is acting as a local backend. Also, the user can submit his
                details with his comment and rating and this information will also be stored on the JSON server and gets displayed immediately in the Comments sub-section
                of the Menu section. In addition to all this, I also got to familiarize myself with ReactJS syntax as I got a chance to work with Observables. This project
                was a part of the Coursera course: Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: Angular 4 and the assets for the project like images and other information were provided by the course developer.
