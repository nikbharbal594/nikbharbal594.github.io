                In this cool and fun project that was a part of the Udacity course on object-oriented JavaScript, I tried recreating
                the classic arcade game Frogger. My task was to write the main object-oriented JS code for creating the player, enemy
                and collectible (gem) objects and also functions for rendering and updating their positions and updating the game level
                while being provided with a game loop engine file and image loading utility file, both written in JavaScript. The game loop engine,
                draws the initial game board on the screen using the HTML canvas, and then calls the update and render
                methods on the player, enemy and gem objects iteratively. The image loading utility file provides a cache facility for 
                frequently used images, and hence makes the image loading process easier.<br>
                The objective of the game in each level is to make the player reach the target, i.e., the water without getting hit
                by the enemy bugs on one of the three rows covered by stone blocks on the game screen. When this is achieved, the 
                game progresses on to the next level. There are three levels in total and the player wins the game when he completes 
                all three levels successfully. The player is given three lives at the start of the game and he loses a life each time
                he gets hit by a bug. Further, the enemies in each level move faster than those in the previous one, thus making it 
                harder to safely make it to the target without getting hit. When a player loses all three of his lives, the game ends 
                and he has to start all over again from level 1. On the other hand, there is a gem to collect in each level popping up at a random 
                position as a reward! The blue gem provides 50 bonus points, the green gem will give 100 and the orange gem will give 200 points.
                Also, the player's score gets increased by 100 points when he completes a level. Putting it in a nutshell, the overall objective of the game
                is to score the maximum number of points possible losing as few lives as possible (or none).
