                Although from an Electrical Engineering background - I have a BE degree in Electronics and
                Communication Engineering and a MS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering - I have always been 
                fascinated by web design and development. I did have elementary knowledge of HTML and knew that this markup 
                language was fundamental to rendering of information on any webpage on the web. However, I wanted to explore
                the world of front-end development/engineering further and know more about the technologies that were being used to create
                the visually stunning interfaces of today that are used for everything from just searching for something on Google to making
                highly secure banking transactions, on a wide range of devices with different screen sizes like phones and laptops.
                <br>
                Thus, my journey into the world of web development began! I completed a number of online courses on popular e-learning platforms
                like Coursera and Udacity, many of which involved a project component to be completed using the technologies just learnt. These courses
                helped me gain a command over the three basic languages that are indispensable for most webpages of today - HTML, CSS and JavaScript and a few related 
                libraries like JQuery and frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular. This site showcases 
                five such projects, by doing which I was able to test my knowledge and also challenge myself. They made me realize the immense passion I
                had for front-end web development and pushed me to consider making it my career. You can find the source code for all these projects on my
                <a href="https://github.com/nikbharbal594">GitHub profile</a>. You can also reach me <a href="#contact">here</a>.
